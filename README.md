# paratrooper

A clone of Paratrooper (1982) developed using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), in ES6 (StandardJS style).

The original game was created by Greg Kuperberg for DOS PCs. I chose to clone this game as it was a family favourite that I used to play with my brother on our Intel 486. It has relatively simple game mechanics but they are still interesting (and at times frustrating) to implement. 

This reimplementation of the game is done as an exercise in learning a new game development framework, practising ES6 syntax, and experimenting with game design patterns. 

My ultimate goal is to finish the project and host it for others to play. 

The original is available to play emulated [on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Paratrooper_1982).
